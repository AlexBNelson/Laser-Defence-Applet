# Laser-Defence-Applet
A simple Java applet tower defence game

This was my first non-trivial java project and served as an introduction to the art of development. It is incomplete, uses the somewhat obsolete AWT and is rather difficult to follow, but provided me with a number of insights, in particular
the importance and planning and the anticipation of problems, and the necessity of testing. It also introduced me to 2d graphics which I employ heavily in my next project, CompositionTool.
