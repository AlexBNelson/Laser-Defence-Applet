# Laser-Defence-Applet
A simple Java applet tower defence game

This was my first non-trivial java project. It is incomplete, uses the somewhat obsolete AWT and is rather difficult to follow, but provided me with a number of insights, in particular the importance and planning and the anticipation of problems, and the necessity of testing. I did manage to produce code which generated random shapes, which was a large part of the project. It used a algorithm whereby I generated 'obstacles' in the game containing rectangles of random size, each of which in turn contained a single point at random coordinates within the rectangle. The points were connected to form the obstacles.
